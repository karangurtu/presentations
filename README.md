# Organization

Three primary organizational structure:

## Chronological

`<year>/<presentation-name>`

e.g.,

```
2015/bosh-micro-cli
2015/bosh-external-cpis
2015/beijing-cf-meetup
```

etc.

## Topics

These are symbolic links to the presentations in the chronological section but organized by topics

`topics/<topic>/<presentation-name>`

e.g.

```
topics/bosh/micro-cli
topics/bosh/external-cpis
```

etc.

## Drafts

`drafts/bosh-external-cpis`

Symlinks that point to the latest presentations that are in draft mode. Always point to the presentations in chronological sections. The list in the `drafts` directory is subject to change and should not be used for final release links.
